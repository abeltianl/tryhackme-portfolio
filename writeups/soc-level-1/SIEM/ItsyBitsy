# 🧠 TryHackMe: [ItsyBitsy](https://tryhackme.com/room/itsybitsy)

## 📌 Overview
- **Room Type**: SOC Analyst / SIEM / Log Analysis
- **Difficulty**: ⭐️⭐️⭐️
- **My Status**: Done

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform event correlation and detection through Kibana/ELK
- Identify a malicious web attack using log data
- Use SOC-level thinking to identify compromise patterns and trace them

---

## 🔧 Key Tools

- Kibana (SIEM)
- HTTP logs
- ELK queries

---

## 🧠 Skills & Concepts Reinforced

- ELK filtering by URI, referrer, user agent, source_ip
- HTTP POST analysis for reverse shell detection

---

## 🔄 Reflection

- **What I learned**:
  - How short URLs can hide malicious destinations
  - The value of combining multiple log fields (user agent, method, URI) for correlation

- **Challenges**:
  - Filtering out noise from dozens of GET requests
  - Tracing reverse shell access back to source IP

- **SOC Relevance**:
  - Realistic log triage process
  - Hands-on exposure to attack chain behavior in a SIEM
